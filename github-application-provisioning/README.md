# Provision GitHub Applications

1. **Generates a JWT for GitHub App authentication.**
2. **Obtains an installation access token.**
3. **Creates or updates a workflow in a repository.**
4. **Triggers the workflow manually (if needed).**
5. **Monitors the workflow run status.**

### **Prerequisites**

1. **Manually Create a GitHub App:**

   GitHub Apps cannot be created via the API or CLI; they must be created manually through the GitHub website. Follow these steps:

   - **Navigate to GitHub Settings:**

     - Go to your GitHub account settings.
     - Click on **Developer settings** in the sidebar.
     - Select **GitHub Apps**.

   - **Create a New GitHub App:**

     - Click **New GitHub App**.
     - Fill in the required details:
       - **App name**
       - **Homepage URL**
       - **Webhook URL** (optional, but useful for event handling)
       - **Callback URL** (if you plan to use OAuth)
     - Under **Permissions & events**, set the necessary permissions:
       - **Actions**: Read & Write
       - **Workflows**: Read & Write
       - **Repositories**: Read & Write (adjust based on your needs)
     - **Subscribe to events** relevant to your workflows if needed.
     - Click **Create GitHub App**.

   - **Generate a Private Key:**

     - After creating the App, generate and download a private key (`.pem` file). **Keep this file secure** as itâ€™s used for authentication.

   - **Install the GitHub App:**
     - Install the App on the desired repositories or organizations. This process will provide you with an **Installation ID**.

2. **Set Up Your Development Environment:**

   - **Python 3.6+** is recommended.
   - Install the required Python packages:
     ```bash
     pip install PyJWT requests
     ```
   - **Git** should be installed if you plan to perform Git operations (e.g., cloning repositories).

### **Python Script Overview**

The Python script will perform the following steps:

1. **Generate a JWT using the App's private key.**
2. **Obtain an Installation Access Token using the JWT.**
3. **Interact with the GitHub API to manage workflows:**
   - Create or update a workflow file.
   - Trigger the workflow manually (optional).
   - Monitor the workflow run status.

### **Script Breakdown**

1. **Configuration Section:**

   - **APP_ID:** Your GitHub App's ID.
   - **PRIVATE_KEY_PATH:** Path to the `.pem` private key file downloaded when creating the App.
   - **INSTALLATION_ID:** The Installation ID where the App is installed. You can obtain this via the GitHub UI or by listing installations via the API.
   - **REPO_OWNER & REPO_NAME:** The owner (user or organization) and repository name where you want to manage workflows.
   - **WORKFLOW_FILE_PATH:** Path to the workflow YAML file within the repository.
   - **WORKFLOW_CONTENT:** The YAML content of the workflow you wish to create or update.
   - **GITHUB_API_URL:** Base URL for GitHub's API.

2. **Helper Functions:**

   - **generate_jwt:** Creates a JWT required for GitHub App authentication using `PyJWT`.
   - **get_installation_access_token:** Exchanges the JWT for an Installation Access Token, which is used for subsequent API calls.
   - **create_or_update_workflow:** Clones the repository, writes the workflow file, commits, and pushes it back. This function uses `subprocess` to execute Git commands. Ensure that Git is installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
   - **trigger_workflow:** Triggers the workflow manually using the `workflow_dispatch` event.
   - **get_latest_workflow_run:** Retrieves the latest workflow run to monitor its status.
   - **monitor_workflow_run:** Polls the workflow run status until it's completed.

3. **Main Execution Flow:**

   - **Generate JWT:** Authenticates as the GitHub App.
   - **Obtain Installation Access Token:** Authenticates as the App installation to perform actions.
   - **Create or Update Workflow:** Ensures the workflow file exists in the repository.
   - **Trigger Workflow:** Optionally triggers the workflow manually.
   - **Monitor Workflow:** Continuously checks the workflow run status until completion.

### **Important Considerations**

1. **Security:**

   - **Protect Your Private Key:** Ensure that your GitHub App's private key (`.pem` file) is stored securely and is **never** exposed in version control or logs.
   - **Environment Variables:** Consider using environment variables or secure storage mechanisms (like AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, etc.) to manage sensitive data.

2. **Dependencies:**

   - **Python Packages:** Ensure `PyJWT` and `requests` are installed.
   - **Git:** The script uses Git via `subprocess`. Make sure Git is installed and properly configured on your system.
   - **Permissions:** The GitHub App must have appropriate permissions to read/write workflows and repositories.

3. **Error Handling:**

   - The script includes basic error handling using `try-except`. For production use, consider implementing more robust error handling and logging mechanisms.

4. **Workflow File Path:**

   - Ensure that the `WORKFLOW_FILE_PATH` corresponds to the correct location within your repository (e.g., `.github/workflows/`).

5. **Rate Limiting:**

   - Be mindful of GitHub's API rate limits. Implement retries or exponential backoff as needed for more resilient scripts.

6. **Installation ID:**

   - If you donâ€™t know your Installation ID, you can retrieve it using the following function:

     ```python
     def list_installations(jwt_token):
         url = f"{GITHUB_API_URL}/app/installations"
         headers = {
             'Authorization': f'Bearer {jwt_token}',
             'Accept': 'application/vnd.github.v3+json'
         }
         response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
         response.raise_for_status()
         return response.json()

     # Usage within main():
     installations = list_installations(jwt_token)
     for install in installations['installations']:
         print(f"Installation ID: {install['id']}, Repository: {install['repository']['full_name']}")
     ```

### **Alternative Approach: Using GitHub's GraphQL API**

While the above script uses GitHub's REST API, you can also leverage GitHub's GraphQL API for more efficient data retrieval and mutations. However, for simplicity and broader compatibility, the REST API approach is often preferred, especially for tasks like workflow management.

### **Conclusion**

By following the above steps and utilizing the provided Python script, you can automate the management of GitHub workflows through a GitHub App with fine-grained permissions. This approach offers a secure and scalable way to interact with GitHub repositories, trigger workflows, and monitor their execution programmatically.

Remember to test the script in a controlled environment before deploying it in production to ensure it behaves as expected.
